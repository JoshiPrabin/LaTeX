\begin{itemize}
    \item The effectiveness of the SAP relies on students having access to digital devices and a stable internet connection. In areas with limited technological infrastructure, some students may face challenges in fully utilizing the platform, potentially leading to unequal access to educational resources.
    \item While efforts will be made to create an intuitive user interface, some users, particularly those less familiar with technology, might experience a learning curve when navigating the SAP. Adequate training and support mechanisms will be essential to address this potential challenge.
    \item Encouraging widespread adoption among students, instructors, and administrative staff is essential for the SAP's success. Overcoming potential resistance to change, ensuring proper training, and effectively communicating the benefits of the platform are challenges that must be addressed.
